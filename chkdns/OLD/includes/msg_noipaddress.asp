CheckDNS is not a tool to verify DNS server configuration; 
it's a tool to verify if some DNS <b>domain</b> is hosted properly 
(primary/secondary DNS, MX servers etc).<br>

<br>
Enter <b>domain name</b> you would like to verify (for example, "mycompany.com"), 
and you'll get a report showing possible problems with this domain.
